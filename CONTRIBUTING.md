## Get Started!

### Development with Docker

If you wish to develop using Docker, there is a `Dockerfile.dev` defined. Please use the following commands:

Build the Dockerfile:
```
docker build --tag=datasetpreparator:devcontainer -f .\docker\Dockerfile.dev .
```

Run the Dockerfile:
```
docker run -it -v .:/app datasetpreparator:devcontainer
```

### Local Development

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `datasetpreparator` for local development. The code style standards that we use are defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

1. Download a copy of `datasetpreparator` locally.
2. Install `datasetpreparator` using `poetry`:

```console
  poetry install
```

3. Install the pre-commit hooks:

```console
  poetry run pre-commit install
```

4. Use `git` (or similar) to create a branch for local development and make your changes:

```console
  git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes conform to any code formatting requirements and pass any tests.

6. Format your commit with `commitizen`:

```console
  poetry run cz commit
```

7. Commit your changes (we are using commitizen to check commit messages) and open a pull request.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include additional tests if appropriate.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for all currently supported operating systems and versions of Python.
