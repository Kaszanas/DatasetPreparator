# SC2DatasetPreparator

This repository contains tools which can be used in order to perform the following steps:

1. Using ```src/directory_flattener.py``` Flatten the directory structure and save the old directory tree to a mapping of ```{"replayUniqueHash": "whereItWasInOldStructure"}```
2. Using ```src/sc2_replaypack_processor``` Perform replaypack processing with https://github.com/Kaszanas/SC2InfoExtractorGo

## Customization

In order to specify different processing flags for https://github.com/Kaszanas/SC2InfoExtractorGo please modify the ```src/sc2_replaypack_processor``` file directly

## Usage

Before using this software please install Python >= 3.7 and ```requirements.txt```.

Please keep in mind that ```src/directory_flattener.py``` does not contain default flag values and can be customized with the following command line flags:

```
usage: directory_flattener.py [-h] [--input_path INPUT_PATH]
                              [--file_extension FILE_EXTENSION]

Directory restructuring tool used in order to flatten the structure, map the
old structure to a separate file, and for later processing with other tools.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input_path INPUT_PATH
                        Please provide input path to the dataset that is going
