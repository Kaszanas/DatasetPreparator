    """
    Exposes logic for downloading a single StarCraft II replaypack from an url.

    Parameters
    ----------
    destination_dir : Path
        Specifies the destination directory where the replaypack will be saved.
    replaypack_name : str
        Specifies the name of a replaypack that will\
        be used for the downloaded .zip archive.
    replaypack_url : str
        Specifies the url that is a direct link\
        to the .zip which will be downloaded.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[Path, bool]
        Returns the path to the downloaded .zip archive of a replaypack. The second element
        of the tuple is a boolean value indicating whether the file was downloaded or not.

    Examples
    --------
    The use of this method is intended
    to download a .zip replaypack containing StarCraft II games.

    Replaypack download directory should be empty before running
    this function.

    Replaypack name will be used as the name for the downloaded .zip archive.

    Replaypack url should be valid and poiting directly to a .zip archive hosted
    on some server.

    The parameters should be set as in the example below. Please note that this is
    not a working example but rather an illustrative one.
